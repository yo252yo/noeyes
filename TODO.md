    <!-- As you know, after the climate collapse, humanity had to be divided in two strict classes, the Streamers and Chat.
    Streamers get to experience all the joy of the Outside™ at the cost of being constantly in public. Chat has no
    access to the Outside™ but enjoys complete privacy. At the end of this training, you will get to chose which class
    you want to be in. -->
