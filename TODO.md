================== GAME ENGINE

* the default avatar resource is failing

* accentuate chat/streamer ratio, in particular make influencers consume more att and make chat smaller and cheaper

* add farmbot feature (class and feature day 6), Ending I shows you your stats if they're machine enough, ending c could show you the list of chats who died 

* add login page (streamer choice) to initialize streamer list, right now its hardcoded

* i got the same color for hive and farm by default

* add disclaimer/explanation about cognitive science

* achivevements for certification every day



================== LONG TERM
* proofread/edit text with grok or chatgpt
* mb adjust speed for phone screens
* add OS start
* update IRC when getting new streamers
* neurosama narration
* iterate on title screen
* rewrite ending.html blurb
* better BGM ???
