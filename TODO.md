Now is a good time to go over the whole codebase and refactor as needed, make sure the code is as clean, factored and maintainabled as can be :) thanks!

* next button is broken on firefox

* purchase influencers and chat

* active streamer should be active target, currentSpawned doesnt make much sense as separate variable its the count of spawned things
let spawnedCount = 0;
let currentSpawned = 0;
< tf is all of this

* need to pause farm and hive when theyre not focused
* STREAMER LIST RN IS HARDCODED
* add an infobulle "so far your value has been controlled by our tutorial, from now on youre on your own!"
* sometimes clicks dont register i think mb because they conflict with drag?
* add minimum window size of like 200x200
* farm starts everyone in the corner maybe on firefox anyway



    <!-- <div id="chatters-list" style="margin-top: 20px; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
    </div>

    <script>
        function updateChattersDisplay() {
            const chatters = getChatters();
            const chattersDiv = document.getElementById('chatters-list');
            if (chatters.length > 0) {
                chattersDiv.innerHTML = '<strong>Live Chatters:</strong><br>' + chatters.join(', ');
            } else {
                chattersDiv.innerHTML = '<em>No chatters yet...</em>';
            }
        }

        // Update chatters display immediately and then every 5 seconds
        updateChattersDisplay();
        setInterval(updateChattersDisplay, 5000);
    </script> -->
