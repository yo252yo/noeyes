* ending pictures:

draw a picture in a moebius/cronenberg/book of speculative human evolution a la douglas dixon style of a futuristic dystopia where humans have split into two forms: the influencers, plastic perfect uncanny photorealist 3d cgi 4k raytracing hyperreal humans, more real than real, and the other half, tiny bug like parasite live right under their skin. can you generate a concept art for this, from the pov of the buglike humanoid, im thinking mb some sort of worm a la dune or something.

draw in the same style a picture of one of these picture perfect hyperreal humans, we dont see any bug, super androgynous human, looking at themselves in the mirror, a bright smile on their face teeth showing picture perfect, but in their eyes theyre actually screaming in agony. the mirror is slightly tinted and we can see a room with grey walls of concrete and empty seats with nobody in it behind, feels like a liminal space
