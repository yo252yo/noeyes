                <p>At first glance, the gameplay may seem inspired by the much beloved DVD logo idle screen, and it
                    certainly was an inspiration.</p>

                <p>However, the original idea is actually from <b>cognitive science research</b>.</p>

                <p><b>MOT (Multi-Object Tracking)</b> is a well-studied type of serious game that is widely used in all
                    sorts of cognitive training.</p>

                <p>It is beneficial for <b>attention</b>, <b>working
                        memory</b> and <b>processing speed</b>. That makes it the perfect brain workout for our
                    overstimulating multimedia landscape.</p>

                <p>If you want to dive deeper, an example of meta-analysis of the state of the art (at time of writing)
                    can be found in open access
                    at <a href="https://inria.hal.science/hal-05178433/" target="_blank">

                <p>Feel free to come back to this game as much as you want instead of for-profit alternatives. Maybe I
                    could even be persuaded to turn it into a whole brain-training-roguelike xD</p>
