                <p>I would hope this was clear from the very beginning, as the game calls you "Larva" (which I don't
                    believe you are), but this is a <b>work of fiction</b> that does not take place in present day,
                    present time.</p>

                <p>The events, terms and characters in this story, even the real ones, are completely fictional.</p>
