                <p>This game reads <a href="https://www.twitch.tv">Twitch</a> chat in real time (directly from your web
                    browser!).</p>
                <p>The integration mostly just pulls streamer avatars and usernames from the chat to use in the game.
                </p>
                <p>That is possible because Twitch uses IRC to power its chatrooms.</p>
                <p>This is very cool, so of course it's only a matter of time before the megacorporation destroys this
                    feature to make its userbase even more captive, as is traditionally the case with technology in
                    cyberpunk dystopias.</p>
                <p><b>Hurry to play with your favorite streamer before it's too late :)</b></p>
                <p>At this point, the game will automatically default to fake usernames, as it will if you request
                    offline channels.</p>
                <p>By the way, the game simply listens in real time to IRC channels. It cannot see past data, and it
                    cannot distinguish between nonexistent channels, offline channels, low-activity chat, etc. Be
                    mindful of typos!
