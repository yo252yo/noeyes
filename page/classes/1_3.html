    <h1 class="welcome-text">Our wise founders to the rescue!</h1>

    <p>After the great collapse, society had to be reorganized to best make use of the few resources we had left!</p>

    <p>That's when our <span class="highlight-text">wise founders</span> came up with the <span
            class="highlight-text">Gender™ System</span> we all know and
        love today!</p>


    <p>Yes, that's how the separation between <span class="highlight-text">Influencers</span> and <span
            class="highlight-text">Chat</span> began!</p>

    <p>So.... Which <span class="highlight-text">Gender™</span> will you chose?</p>

    <div class="info-panel">
        <p>At the end of this weeklong program, you should be able to make an informed and consensual choice about your
            <span class="highlight-text">Gender™</span> choice. As required by law, this choice must result from your
            sole personal individual volition and it is your responsibility to report any external pressure or influence
            that could be biasing your choice.<br />
            With this out of the way, please press the <span class="highlight-text">rad butterfly</span>.
