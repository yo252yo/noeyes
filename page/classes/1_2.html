    <p>Before the climate collapse, our ancestors lived all together without clear <span
            class="highlight-text">Gender™</span> distinction!</p>

        <span class="highlight-text">quite a mess</span>!
    </p>

    <div class="info-panel">
        <p>There were cases of segregation here and there based on arbitrary attributes, and even some primitive forms
            of gender! But they were nothing quite like the comprehensive system have now.</p>
