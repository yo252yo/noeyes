    <p>Before the ecosystem collapse, our ancestors lived together without clear <span
            class="highlight-text">Gender™</span> distinction!</p>

        <span class="highlight-text">quite a mess</span>!
    </p>

    <div class="info-panel">

            of gender! But they were nothing quite like the comprehensive system we have now.</p>
